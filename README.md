## General informations
All credits to https://paleopines.com/ . This is just an exercise to make something good with less time (around five hours) than usual.
There are many changes to make but it's a good start.
I'm using React and Mantine, with a first try of a custom color via mantine provider. (yes, I made a typo with the title, it's paleopines not peleopines. My bad, have a nice day nonetheless). 

## Technologies 
* React version 18.2.0
* Mantine version 6.0.10
